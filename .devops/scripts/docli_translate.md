For Google Cloud Translation API:
The codes listed above under "ISO 639-1 Language Codes" will work. Google supports a vast number of languages and their variants. For instance, both zh-CN (Simplified Chinese) and zh-TW (Traditional Chinese) are valid. If targeting Brazilian Portuguese specifically, you'd use pt-BR.

For OpenAI's ChatGPT:
For translation tasks with ChatGPT, you'd generally specify the full language name in English within your prompt, such as "Translate the following text to French." However, it's good to note that ChatGPT isn't a dedicated translation model, and results may vary. You'd refer to the languages in a more natural, conversational manner:

Français: "French"
简体中文: "Simplified Chinese"
Español: "Spanish"
Deutsch: "German"
日本語: "Japanese"
Português Brasileiro: "Brazilian Portuguese"
Italiano: "Italian"
한국어: "Korean"
Nederlands: "Dutch"
नेपाली: "Nepali"
Türkçe: "Turkish"
